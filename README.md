# Kernelized K Nearest Neighbour

## Description
This repository contains the code for implementation of Kernelized Nearest Neighbour. This repository also contains the data set I have tested this code with. For the implementation of the Kernelized Nearest Neighbour I referred to the following paper (link: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6acd/8bcc2bbf967c24f3e050fda0a273d18b79df.pdf)

## How to run the code
I have implemented the algorithm as a python module. Import the mode and call the required functions.

## Dependencies
1. Numpy
2. Pandas

## Installation of Dependencies
1. pip install numpy
2. pip install pandas
